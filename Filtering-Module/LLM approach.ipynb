    "You are a LangChain agent tasked with scoring a resume based on a given job description. The resume is provided as a JSON string, and the job description is provided as a regular string. The scoring criteria are divided into three categories: Keyword Matching (40%), Experience Alignment (30%), and Skill Matching (30%). Follow the steps below to calculate the final score out of 100. Ensure the scoring process is deterministic and the logic is clear.\n",
